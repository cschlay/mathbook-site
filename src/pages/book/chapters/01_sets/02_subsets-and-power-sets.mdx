<Quoted source="olp">
  We will often want to compare sets. One kind of comparison is: _everything in one set is in the other (set) too_.
  This situation is sufficiently important for us to introduce some new notation.

  <Definition name="Subset">
    If every element of a set $A$ is also an element of $B$,
    then we say that $A$ is a _subset_ of $B$, and we write $A \subseteq B$.
    If $A \subseteq B$ but $A \neq B$,
    we write $A \subset B$,
    and say that $A$ is a _proper subset_ of $B$.
  </Definition>
</Quoted>

The notation $\subset$ is used because they are similar to equality operators $\leq$ and $<$. You may also see $\subsetneq$ in other literature.
The corresponding latex symbols are `\subset`, `\subseteq`, and `\subsetneq`.

<Quoted source="olp">
  <Example name="Basics">
    Every set is a subset of itself, and $\emptyset$ is a subset of every set.
    The set of even numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers. Also $\{a, b\} \subseteq \{a, b, c\}$.
    But $\{a, b, e\}$ is not a subset of $\{a, b, c\}$.
  </Example>

Applying subsets is useful for checking validity of something e.g. ensuring that a customer have chosen appropriate combination of items.
The chefs check that they have chosen ingredients from available sets before planning the servings.
The managers compare software features against the requirements.

<Example name="Pizza toppings">
  Let all pizza toppings be a $A = \{ ham, kebab, cheese, tomato \}$.
  Choosing any subset of toppings would result in a pizza that have name e.g. ham or cheese pizza.
  A kebab pizza would be a proper subset $B = \{ kebab, cheese \}$ so $B \subset A$.
</Example>

In Python the example would be written as

```python
pizza_toppings: set[str] = { "ham", "kebab", "mozzarella", "tomato" }
kebab_pizza: set[str] = { "kebab", "mozzarella" }

print(kebab_pizza.issubset(pizza_toppings))
# True
```

<Quoted>
<Proposition>
  $A = B$ iff both $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
</Proposition>
<Definition name="Power Set">
  The set consisting of all subsets of a set $A$ is called _power set of_ $A$, written $\wp(A)$:
  $$
    \wp(A) = \{ B \mid B \subseteq A \}.
  $$
</Definition>
</Quoted>

The symbol <tex value="\wp"/> can be written `\wp` in TeX (perhaps short for _Weierstrass p-function_).
You may also encounter different power set notations that uses different styles of "p" such as $P(A)$.

<Example name="Different soups">
  Soups can have any combination of ingredients and still taste good.
  The chef wants a list of all soups he can make from a set of ingredients $S = \{ salmon, potato \}$.
  That power set that describes all combinations is
  $$
    \wp(S) = \{ \emptyset, \{ salmon \}, \{ potato \}, \{ potato, carrot \} \}.
  $$
</Example>

  <Problem>
    List all subsets of $\{ a, b, c, d\}$.
  </Problem>

  <Problem>
    Show that if $A$ has $n$ elements, then $\wp(A)$ has $2^n$ elements.
  </Problem>
