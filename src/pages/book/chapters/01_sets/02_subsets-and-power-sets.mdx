  We will often want to compare sets. One kind of comparison is: _everything in one set is in the other (set) too_.
  This situation is sufficiently important for us to introduce some new notation.

  <Definition name="Subset">
    If every element of a set <tex>A</tex> is also an element of <tex>B</tex>,
    then we say that <tex>A</tex> is a <em>subset</em> of <tex>B</tex>, and we write <tex>A \subseteq B</tex>.
    If <tex>A \subseteq B</tex> but <tex>A \neq B</tex>,
    we write <tex>A \subset B</tex>,
    and say that <tex>A</tex> is a <em>proper subset</em> of <tex>B</tex>.
  </Definition>

</Quoted>

The notation <tex value="\subset" /> is used because they are similar to equality operators <tex value="\leq"/> and <tex value="<"/>. You may also see <tex value="\subsetneq"/> in other literature.
The corresponding latex symbols are `\subset`, `\subseteq`, and `\subsetneq`.

<Quoted source="olp">
  <Example name="Basics">
    Every set is a subset of itself, and <tex>\emptyset</tex> is a subset of every set.
    The set of even numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers. Also <tex>{"\\{a,b\\} \\subseteq \\{a,b,c\\}"}</tex>.
    But <tex>{"\\{a,b,e\\}"}</tex> is not a subset of <tex>{"\\{a,b,c\\}"}</tex>.
  </Example>

Applying subsets is useful for checking validity of something e.g. ensuring that a customer have chosen appropriate combination of items.
The chefs check that they have chosen ingredients from available sets before planning the servings.
The managers compare software features against the requirements.

<Example name="Pizza toppings">
  Let all pizza toppings be a <tex value="A = \{ ham, kebab, cheese, tomato \}." block={true}/>
  Choosing any subset of toppings would result in a pizza that have name e.g. ham or cheese pizza.
  A kebab pizza would be a proper subset <tex value="B = \{ kebab, cheese \}," block={true} /> so <tex>B \subset A</tex>.
  If were replace the names with icons, the sets would be <span className="flex-center"><tex value="A = \{"/><GiHamShank/>, <GiDonerKebab />, <GiCheeseWedge/>, <GiTomato/> <tex value="\}"/></span> and <span className="flex-center"><tex value="B = \{"/><GiDonerKebab/>, <GiCheeseWedge/> <tex value="\}"/></span>.

</Example>

In Python the example would be written as

```python
pizza_toppings: set[str] = { "ham", "kebab", "mozzarella", "tomato" }
kebab_pizza: set[str] = { "kebab", "mozzarella" }

print(kebab_pizza.issubset(pizza_toppings))
# True
```

<Quoted>

<Proposition>
  <tex>A = B</tex>{' '}
  iff both <tex>A \subseteq B</tex> and <tex>B \subseteq A</tex>.
</Proposition>

<Definition name="Power Set">
  The set consisting of all subsets of a set <tex>A</tex> is called <em>power set of</em>{' '}
  <tex>A</tex>
  , written <tex>\wp(A)</tex>:
  <tex value="\wp(A) = \{ B \mid B \subseteq A \}." block={true}/>
</Definition>

</Quoted>

The symbol <tex value="\wp"/> can be written `\wp` in TeX (perhaps short for _Weierstrass p-function_).
You may also encounter different power set notations that uses different styles of "p" such as <tex value="P(A)"/>.

<Example name="Different soups">
  Soups can have any combination of ingredients and still taste good.
  The chef wants a list of all soups he can make from a set of ingredients <tex
  value="S = \{ salmon, potato \}." block={true}/><span className="flex-center"></span>
  That power set that describes all combinations is
  <tex block={true} value="\wp(S) = \{ \emptyset, \{ salmon \}, \{ potato \}, \{ potato, carrot \} \}."/>
</Example>

<Quoted>
  <Problem>
    <p>List all subsets of <tex value="\{ a, b, c, d\}"/>.</p>
  </Problem>

  <Problem>
    Show that if <tex value="A"/> has <tex value="n"/> elements, then <tex value="\wp(A)"/> has <tex value="2^n" /> elements.
  </Problem>
