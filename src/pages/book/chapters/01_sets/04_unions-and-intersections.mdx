The set generator notation <tex value="\{ x \mid f(x) \}" /> creates new set.
Although the notation only generate sets, it is powerful enough define basic set operations: _union_, _intersection_, and _difference_.

<Quoted>

<Definition name="Union">

  The _union_ of two sets <tex>A</tex> and <tex>B</tex> is the set of all things which are elements of <tex>A</tex>, <tex>B</tex>, or both.
  <tex value="A \cup B = \{ x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}" block />

</Definition>

</Quoted>

The union operator is useful for combining two sets of things into one such as films seen by two persons can be represented as sets <tex>A</tex> and <tex>B</tex>.
Now that if they are to go cinema, they can create a new set <tex>C</tex> to determine the films either of them has seen.

<Example name="Films seen by two friends">

  Two young friends are trying decide a film to watch, but they can only choose from films either of them owns. Friend <tex>A</tex> is a Star Wars fan and bought films
  <tex value="A = \{ \textit{A New Hope}, \textit{The Force Awakens} \}," block/>
  the friend <tex>B</tex> loves superhero films and has a collection
  <tex value="B = \{ \textit{Iron Man}, \textit{Spiderman 1} \}." block/>
  The films they can watch is a set
  <tex value="C = \{ \textit{A New Hope}, \textit{The Force Awakens}, \textit{Iron Man}, \textit{Spiderman 1} \}." block/>
