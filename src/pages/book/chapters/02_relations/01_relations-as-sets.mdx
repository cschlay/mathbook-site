  <Definition name="Binary relation">
    A _binary relation_ on a set $A$ is a subset of $A^2 = A \times A$.
    If $R \subseteq A^2$ is a binary relation on $A$ and $x, y \in A$, we write $xRy$ for $(x, y) \in R$.
  </Definition>

The relation is indeed a rule that defines the set $R$ of pairs.
The most basic relation is _identity relation_ where elements relate themselves $(x, x) \in R$ when $x \in A$, denoted as $\text{Id}_A$.

<Example>
  Let $A = \{ \textit{shorts}, \textit{t-shirt}, \textit{sweater}, \textit{socks} \}$,
  when we define a relation "items that are normally worn together" the result would be $R = \{ (\textit{shorts}, \textit{t-shirt}), (\textit{sweater}, \textit{socks}) \}$.
</Example>

This may remind you of _relational databases_.
Each row consist of pairs in $R$ such as $(\textit{shorts}, \textit{t-shirt})$ and elements are the columns.
If we were to define three columns, we would need to define relation of relations $((\textit{shorts}, \textit{t-shirt}), \textit{sandals})$.

## Special Properties of Relations

<Quoted>

  Some kinds of relations turn out to be so common that they have been given special names.
  To get at exactly how these relations are similar, and how they differ,
  we categorize them according to some special properties that relation can have.
  It turns out that some of these special properties are especially important: orders and equivalence relations.

  <Definition name="Reflexivity">
    A relation $R \subseteq A^2$ is _reflexive_ iff, for every $x \in A$, $xRx$.
  </Definition>

  <Definition name="Transitivity">
    A relation $R \subseteq A^2$ is _transitive_ iff, whenever $xRy$ and $yRz$, then also $xRz$.
  </Definition>

  <Definition name="Symmetry">
    A relation $R \subseteq A^2$ is _symmetric_ iff, whenever $xRy$, then also $yRx$.
  </Definition>

</Quoted>

The _anti-symmetric_ relation is the opposite of symmetric relation, where the reverse is never true except when $x = y$.
However, the relation may not be reflexive.
