  <Definition name="Binary relation">
    A <em>binary relation</em> on a set <tex>A</tex> is a subset of <tex>A^2 = A \times A</tex>.
    If <tex>R \subseteq A^2</tex> is a binary relation on <tex>A</tex> and <tex>x, y \in A</tex>, we write <tex>xRy</tex> for <tex>(x, y) \in R</tex>.
  </Definition>

The relation is indeed a rule that defines the set <tex>R</tex> of pairs.
The most basic relation is <em>identity relation</em> where elements relate themselves <tex value="(x, x) \in R"/> when <tex value="x \in A"/>, denoted as <tex value="\text{Id}_A"/>.

<Example>
  Let <tex>{"A = \\{ \\text{shorts}, \\text{t-shirt}, \\text{sweater}, \\text{socks} \\}"}</tex>,
  when we define a relation "items that are normally worn together" the result would be <tex>{"R = \\{ (\\text{shorts}, \\text{t-shirt}), (\\text{sweater}, \\text{socks}) \\}"}</tex>.
</Example>

This may remind you of _relational databases_.
Each row consist of pairs in <tex>R</tex> such as <tex value="(\text{shorts}, \text{t-shirt})"/> and elements are the columns.
If we were to define three columns, we would need to define relation of relations <tex value="((\text{shorts}, \text{t-shirt}), \text{sandals})"/>.

## Special Properties of Relations

<Quoted>

  Some kinds of relations turn out to be so common that they have been given special names.
  To get at exactly how these relations are similar, and how they differ,
  we categorize them according to some special properties that relation can have.
  It turns out that some of these special properties are especially important: orders and equivalence relations.

  <Definition name="Reflexivity">
    A relation <tex>R \subseteq A^2</tex> is <em>reflexive</em> iff, for every <tex>x \in A</tex>, <tex>xRx</tex>.
  </Definition>

  <Definition name="Transitivity">
    A relation <tex>R \subseteq A^2</tex> is <em>transitive</em> iff, whenever <tex>xRy</tex> and <tex>yRz</tex>, then also <tex>xRz</tex>.
  </Definition>

  <Definition name="Symmetry">
    A relation <tex>R \subseteq A^2</tex> is <em>symmetric</em> iff, whenever <tex>xRy</tex>, then also <tex>yRx</tex>.
  </Definition>

</Quoted>

The _anti-symmetric_ relation is the opposite of symmetric relation, where the reverse is never true except when <tex value="x = y"/>.
However, the relation may not be reflexive.
