A _set_ is a collection of objects<!--, considered as a single object -->.
The objects in the set are called _elements_ of the set.

- If $x$ is an element of a set $S$, we write $x \in S$. `x \in S`
- If is not in set $S$, we write $x \notin S$. `x \notin S`
- The set which has no elements is called _empty set_ and denoted $\emptyset$. `\emptyset`

It does not matter how we specify the set, or how we order its elements or how many times we count its elements.
All that matters are what its elements are.
