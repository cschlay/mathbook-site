A _set_ is a collection of objects.
The objects in the set are called _elements_ of the set.

- If $x$ is an element of a set $S$, we write $x \in S$;
- If not, we write $x \notin S$.
- The set which has no elements is called _empty set_ and denoted $\emptyset$.

It does not matter how we specify the set, or how we order its elements or how many times we count its elements.
All that matters are what its elements are.

<Definition name="Extensionality">
    If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A = B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and vice versa.
</Definition>

In general, when we have objects $a_1, \ldots, a_n$, then $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ is the set $S$ whose elements are $a_1, \ldots, a_n$.
There can be only one such set:

$$
    S = \{ a, a, b \} = \{ a, b \} = \{ b, a \}.
$$

We usually don't write out duplicate elements since they have no meaning as extensionality reduces them to same set.

<Example name="Color Palette">
    {"Colors used in a website design can be thought as a set $S = \\{blue, green, orange\\}$. Choosing another blue of same tone is still same blue. If two websites use same colors, they use same set of colors."}
</Example>

In practice, sets can be used to check if something exists in something e.g. if a recipe for cake contains milk or not.
The ingredient listing in consumable products usually don't show quantity, so they can be represented as a set.

```python
cake: set = { "flour", "milk", "butter" }

def contains_dairy(ingredients: set):
    return "milk" in ingredients or "butter" in ingredients
```

Usually in programming using lists would suffice as well, but you can save memory by using sets.
