A _set_ is a collection of objects.
The objects in the set are called _elements_ of the set.

- If $x$ is an element of a set $S$, we write $x \in S$;
- If not, we write $x \notin S$.
- The set which has no elements is called _empty set_ and denoted $\emptyset$.

It does not matter how we specify the set, or how we order its elements or how many times we count its elements.
All that matters are what its elements are.

<Definition name="Extensionality">
    If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A = B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and vice versa.
