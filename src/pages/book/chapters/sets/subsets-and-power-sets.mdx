  We will often want to compare sets. One kind of comparison is: _everything in one set is in the other (set) too_.
  This situation is sufficiently important for us to introduce some new notation.

  <Definition name="Subset">
    If every element of a set <tex>A</tex> is also an element of <tex>B</tex>,
    then we say that <tex>A</tex> is a <em>subset</em> of <tex>B</tex>, and we write <tex>A \subseteq B</tex>.
    If <tex>A \subseteq B</tex> but <tex>A \neq B</tex>,
    we write <tex>A \subset B</tex>,
    and say that <tex>A</tex> is a <em>proper subset</em> of <tex>B</tex>.
  </Definition>

The notation $\subset$ is used because they are similar to equality operators $\leq$ and $<$. You may also see $\subsetneq$ in other literature.

<Quoted source="olp">
  <Example name="Basics">
    Every set is a subset of itself, and <tex>\emptyset</tex> is a subset of every set.
    The set of even numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers. Also <tex>{"\\{a,b\\} \\subseteq \\{a,b,c\\}"}</tex>.
    But <tex>{"\\{a,b,e\\}"}</tex> is not a subset of <tex>{"\\{a,b,c\\}"}</tex>.
  </Example>

Applying subsets is useful for check validity of something such as that a customer have chosen
appropriate combination of items. Or to check that surgery has sanitized tools, each tool has unique id.

<Example name="Pizza toppings">
  All pizza toppings are a set <tex>{"A = \\{ \\text{ham}, \\text{kebab}, \\text{mozzarella}, \\text{tomato} \}"}</tex>.
  Choosing any subset of toppings would result in a pizza that have name ham pizza, mozzarella pizza etc.
  A kebab pizza would be a proper subset <tex>{"B = \\{ \text{kebab}, \\text{mozzarella} \\}"}</tex>, so <tex>B \subset A</tex>.
</Example>

In Python the example would be written as

```python
pizza_toppings: set[str] = { "ham", "kebab", "mozzarella", "tomato" }
kebab_pizza: set[str] = { "kebab", "mozzarella" }

print(kebab_pizza.issubset(pizza_toppings))
# True
```

<Quoted>

<Proposition>
  <tex>A = B</tex>
  iff both <tex>A \subseteq B</tex> and <tex>B \subseteq A</tex>.
</Proposition>

<Definition name="Power Set">
  The set consisting of all subsets of a set <tex>A</tex> is called <em>power set of</em>
  <tex>A</tex>
  , written <tex>\wp(A)</tex>.
  <tex block={true}>{"\\wp(A) = \\{ B \\mid B \\subseteq A \\}"}</tex>
</Definition>

</Quoted>

The symbol $\wp$ can be written `\wp` in TeX (perhaps short for _Weierstrass p-function_).
You may also encounter different power set notations that uses different styles of "p" e.g. $P(A)$.

<Example name="Different soups">
  The soups can have any combination of ingredients and still taste good.
  The chef wants a list of all soups he can make from a set of ingredients <tex
  math="S = \{ \\text{salmon}, \\text{potato}, \\text{carrot} \\}"/>.
  That would be <tex
  blocK={true}>{"\\wp(S) = \\{ \\emptyset, \\{ \\text{salmon, potato, carrot} \\}, \\{ \\text{salmon, potato} \\}, \\{ \\text{salmon, carrot} \\}, \\{\\text{potato, carrot}\\} \\}."}</tex>
</Example>
