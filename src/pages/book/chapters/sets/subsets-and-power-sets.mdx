We will often want to compare sets. One kind of comparison is: _everything in one set is in the other (set) too_.
This situation is sufficiently important for us to introduce some new notation.

<Definition name="Subset">
    If every element of a set <Tex math="A"/> is also an element of <Tex math="B" />,
    then we say that <Tex math="A"/> is a <em>subset</em> of <Tex math="B"/>, and we write <Tex math="A \subseteq B"/>.
    If <Tex math="A \subseteq B" /> but <Tex math="A \neq B" />,
    we write <Tex math="A \subset B" />,
    and say that <Tex math="A" /> is a <em>proper subset</em> of <Tex math="B" />.
</Definition>

The notation $\subset$ is used because they are similar to equality operators $\leq$ and $<$. You may also see $\subsetneq$ in other literature.

<Example name="Basics">
    Every set is a subset of itself, and <Tex math="\emptyset"/> is a subset of every set.
    The set of even numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers. Also <Tex math="\{a,b\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}"/>. But <Tex math="\{a,b,e\}" /> is not a subset of <Tex math="\{a,b,c\}"/>.

Applying subsets is useful for check validity of something such as that a customer have chosen
appropriate combination of items. Or to check that surgery has sanitized tools, each tool has unique id.

<Example name="Pizza toppings">
    All pizza toppings are a set <Tex math="A = \{ \text{ham}, \text{kebab}, \text{mozzarella}, \text{tomato} \}" />.
    Choosing any subset of toppings would result in a pizza that have name ham pizza, mozzarella pizza etc.
    A kebab pizza would be a proper subset <Tex math="B = \{ \text{kebab}, \text{mozzarella} \}" />, so <Tex math="B \subset A" />.
</Example>

In Python the example would be written as

```python
pizza_toppings: set[str] = { "ham", "kebab", "mozzarella", "tomato" }
kebab_pizza: set[str] = { "kebab", "mozzarella" }

print(kebab_pizza.issubset(pizza_toppings))
# True
```

<!-- SOURCE: OLP -->

<Proposition>
    <Tex math="A = B" /> iff both <Tex math="A \subseteq B"/> and <Tex math="B \subseteq A" />.
</Proposition>

<Definition name="Power Set">
    The set consisting of all subsets of a set <Tex math="A"/> is called <em>power set of</em> <Tex math="A"/>, written <Tex math="\wp(A)"/>.
    <Tex math="\wp(A) = \{ B \mid B \subseteq A \}" block/>
</Definition>

The symbol $\wp$ can be written `\wp` in TeX (perhaps short for _Weierstrass p-function_).
You may also encounter different power set notations that uses different styles of "p" e.g. $P(A)$.

<Example name="Different soups">
    The soups can have any combination of ingredients and still taste good.
    The chef wants a list of all soups he can make from a set of ingredients <Tex math="S = \{ \text{salmon}, \text{potato}, \text{carrot} \}"/>.
    That would be <Tex math="\wp(S) = \{ \emptyset, \{ \text{salmon, potato, carrot} \}, \{ \text{salmon, potato} \}, \{ \text{salmon, carrot} \}, \{\text{potato, carrot}\} \}." block/>
</Example>
