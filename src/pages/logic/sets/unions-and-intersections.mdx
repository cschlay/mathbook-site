The set generator notation $\{ x \mid f(x) \}$ creates new set.
Although the notation only generate sets, it is powerful enough define basic set operations: _union_, _intersection_, and _difference_.

<Quoted>
<Definition name="Union">
  The _union_ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all things which are elements of $A$, $B$, or both.
  $$
    A \cup B = \{ x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}
  $$
</Definition>

The union operator is useful for combining two sets of things into one such as films seen by two persons can be represented as sets $A$ and $B$.
Now that if they are to go cinema, they can create a new set $C$ to determine the films either of them has seen.

<Example name="Films seen by two friends">
  Two young friends are trying decide a film to watch, but they can only choose from films either of them owns. Friend $A$ is a Star Wars fan and bought films
  $$
    A = \{ \textit{A New Hope}, \textit{The Force Awakens} \},
  $$
  the friend $B$ loves superhero films and has a collection
  $$
    B = \{ \textit{Iron Man}, \textit{Spiderman 1} \}.
  $$
  The films they can watch is a union $A \cup B$ which forms a new set
  $$
    C = \{ \textit{A New Hope}, \textit{The Force Awakens}, \textit{Iron Man}, \textit{Spiderman 1} \}.
  $$
